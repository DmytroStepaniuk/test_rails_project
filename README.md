This is TEST_RAILS_PROJECT

The idea of this project is to have a well-tuned Ruby On Rails project that runs in Devcontainer.

Devcontainer is a great place to develop. It allows to not care about different libraries u need to install on ur computer.

The reason why this project appeared - im bored to install ffmpeg, wkhtmltopdf, libvips, ImageMagick, poppler and etc
